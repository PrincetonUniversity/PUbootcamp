title: Code of Conduct
---

We are committed to providing a welcoming and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of Bootcamp participants in any form. This code of conduct applies to all participants, including Princeton staff and applies to all modes of interaction, both in-person and online.

Princeton Research Computing Bootcamp participants agree to:  

* Be considerate in speech and actions, and actively seek to acknowledge and respect the boundaries of fellow attendees.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Harassment includes, but is not limited to: deliberate intimidation; stalking; unwanted photography or recording; sustained or willful disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes; and unwelcome sexual attention. If you feel that someone has harassed you or otherwise treated you inappropriately, please alert any member of the bootcamp team in person.
* Alert a Bootcamp instructor or organizer if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
* Abide and adhere to PUâ€™s [Rights, Rules, Responsibilities](https://rrr.princeton.edu/)

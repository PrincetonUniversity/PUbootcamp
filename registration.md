Please register at [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/princeton-research-computing-bootcamp-tickets-49565867845).  

__Update 9/11/18:__ We have run out of space, but are actively looking to move the bootcamp to another room on campus with a larger seating capacity.  If successful, we will be able to accommodate many more from the waitlist.  We will be accepting people from the waitlist in the order they registered. 


[Registration](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/princeton-research-computing-bootcamp-tickets-49565867845) is open to all current Princeton University researchers/students.  Seating is extremely limited and we expect to run out of space.  Advanced registration is required and **participants are expected to attend all 4 days.**  If you are unable to attend the entire bootcamp, but would still like to attend a portion of it, please email us at [rcinfo@princeton.edu](mailto:rcinfo@princeton.edu) with your availability and we will add you to the wait list. If seats are available we will do the best we can to accommodate as many participants as possible.


We hope that this will become an annual or semi-annual event. With sufficient interest we will likely be able offer it again. If for any reason you cannot attend the bootcamp but would like to express interest in a future bootcamp, please email us at [rcinfo@princeton.edu](mailto:rcinfo@princeton.edu).

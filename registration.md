Please check back in early September 2018 to register.

Registration is open to all members of the Princeton research community (e.g. graduate students, postdocs, research staff, and faculty).  Non-research staff interested are asked to please delay registration to reserve seats.  Space is extremely limited and we expect to run out of space.  Advanced registration is required and **participants are expected to attend all 4 days.**  If you are unable to attend the entire bootcamp, but are still interested to attend a portion, please email us at [rcinfo@princeton.edu](mailto:rcinfo@princeton.edu) to discuss waitlist options. If seats remain we will do the best we can to accommodate as many participants as possible.

We hope that this will become an annual or semi-annual event. With sufficient interest we will likely be able offer it again. If you cannot attend the bootcamp but would like to express interest in a future bootcamp, please email us at [rcinfo@princeton.edu](mailto:rcinfo@princeton.edu).

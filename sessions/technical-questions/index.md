There are two very common types of technical questions: “How do I do X?” and “Can you help me figure out why what I’m doing isn’t working?” During this session we will discuss: (1) what to do before asking either type of question; (2) what kind of information is/is not helpful to include when explaining your question; (3) how to create a minimal, complete, verifiable code snippet that illustrates the problem you’re having; and (4) what to do after you’ve asked your question.

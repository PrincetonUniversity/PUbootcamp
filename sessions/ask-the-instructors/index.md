title: Ask the Instructors
---

This final, informal session will bring the instructors from earlier sessions back to answer questions one-on-one and in small groups.  Bootcamp attendees should feel free to use this time ask for clarification or more detail about previously covered material as well as discussion additional specific topics relevant to their work.

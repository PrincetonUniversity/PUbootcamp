We will start with basics of distributed memory parallel computing with MPI covering topics including: environment management, point-to-point communication, and collective communication routines.  Then basic OpenMP constructs for specifying parallel regions, work sharing, synchronization, and environment management will be introduced.  Hands on programming exercises will allow participants practice implementing converting existing serial code to run in parallel.

This workshop will focus on the fundamentals of using Linux command line tools,
with an emphasis on the GNU flavored inflections of such common utilities as
grep, find, and other stand-bys of BASH scripting. In a mixture of lecture
and hands-on activities, attendees will learn in depth ways to
and make day-to-day tasks on HPC systems easier.

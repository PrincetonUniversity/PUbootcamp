instructor: Dawn Koffman

This session provides a discussion of issues to consider when designing statistical graphs. Topics include:

tables vs graphs
audience and setting
representing data accurately
highlighting comparisons of interest
simplicity and clarity
color
Several sets of graphs are examined that attempt to "tell the same story" and discussion will center on why one display may be preferable to another. While the workshop goes over the pros and cons of using bar graphs, dot plots, line graphs, box plots, violin plots and several other graph types, the discussion is implementation tool independent

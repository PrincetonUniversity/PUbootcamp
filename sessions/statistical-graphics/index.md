instructor: Dawn Koffman 
---



This session provides a discussion of issues to consider when designing statistical graphs. Topics include:

tables vs graphs <br>
audience and setting <br>
representing data accurately <br>
highlighting comparisons of interest <br>
simplicity and clarity <br>
color <br>

Several sets of graphs are examined that attempt to "tell the same story" and discussion will center on why one display may be preferable to another. While the session goes over the pros and cons of using bar graphs, dot plots, line graphs, box plots, violin plots and several other graph types, the discussion is implementation tool independent

This session provides a discussion of issues to consider when designing statistical graphs. Topics will include: (1) tables vs graphs; (2) audience and setting; (3) representing data accurately; (4) highlighting comparisons of interest; and (5) simplicity and clarity. We will examine several sets of graphs that attempt to “tell the same story” and will discuss why one display may be preferable to another. While the session will cover the pros and cons of using bar graphs, dot plots, line graphs, box plots, violin plots and several other graph types, the discussion will be entirely implementation-tool independent.

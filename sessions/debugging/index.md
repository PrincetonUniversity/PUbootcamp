title: Introduction to Debugging
instructor: Stephane Ethier

Debugging single processor codes is already a daunting task that usually consumes a lot of development time. Luckily, several debugging tools are available to help the developer pinpoint the problem by controlling the state of execution. When dealing with large multi-processor codes, however, this task becomes a true challenge. Fortunately, advanced debugging tools, such as the DDT debugger from Allinea, can help speed up the process. This course will demonstrate how to use DDT with example codes so that participants leave with practical knowledge of this powerful tool.

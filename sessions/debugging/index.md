title: Introduction to Debugging
instructor: Stephane Ethier
---



Debugging is often the most time-consuming step of code development. Fortunately, there are several tools available to users to speed up this task and the ARM DDT debugger is probably the most advanced among them. While debugging a single processor code is already a daunting task, dealing with a large multi-processor code becomes a true challenge. Luckily, the DDT debugger can handle multi-processor codes as easily as single-processor ones. This presentation will give the participants practical knowledge of code debugging using DDT as well as other straightforward methods based on experience and good software development practices.

Fundamentally, a Version Control System (VCS) is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time, so that you can recall specific versions later. Git is a modern VCS that is fast and flexible to use thanks to its lightweight branch creation. Git is very popular, this is due in part to the availability of cloud hosting services like GitHub, Bitbucket and GitLab. Hosting a Git repositories on a remote service like GitHub greatly facilitates working collaboratively as well as allowing you to frequently backup your work on a remote host.
We will start this talk by introducing the fundamental concepts of Git. The second part of the talk will show how to publish to a remote repository on GitHub.

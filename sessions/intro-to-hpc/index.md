This session will introduce attendees to HPC concepts, teach them how to use
the research computing clusters at Princeton, and offer some refreshers/tutorial
on useful elements of SSH and the Linux Bash command line. It will
equip attendees with some of the basic skills needed to connect to
a Springdale Linux research computing cluster at Princeton such as Adroit,
navigate the environment and file system, and then run a script or program
through the SLURM scheduler.  The format will include a mixture of lecture and
hands-on activities.

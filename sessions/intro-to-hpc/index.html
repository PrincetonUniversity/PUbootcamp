title: Getting started with HPC Systems and Bash Command line
---

Instructor: Ben Hicks

This session will introduce attendees to HPC concepts, teach them how to use the research computing clusters at Princeton, and offer some refreshers/tutorial on useful elements of SSH and the Linux Bash command line.
This session will equip attendees with some of the basic skills needed to connect to a Springdale Linux research computing cluster at Princeton such as Adroit, navigate the environment and file system, and then run a script or program through the SLURM scheduler.  It will have a mixture of hands-on practice and lecture.

Princeton Research Computing provides centralized infrastructure and services to support the computational and data science needs of our faculty, researchers, and students.  This session will provide a summary of the resources available to the Princeton community.  The conversation will include a technical overview of the three large HPC clusters, smaller systems, and massive parallel file systems as well as a discussion of how to choose the right systems for your research and how to get access once you have chosen.  In addition to the infrastructure, we will also discuss the ways we can help you successfully use our systems â€“ our staff who provide visualization and programming support, our programs for education and training, and outreach activities that strengthen the computational and data science communities on campus.

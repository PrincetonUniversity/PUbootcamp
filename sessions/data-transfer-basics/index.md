title: Data Transfer Basics & Tutorial
instructor: Hyojoon Kim

Performance Computing (HPC) grows, datasets are also getting larger and more diverse. Finding enough storage space is one issue, but another big problem is moving these large datasets (raw or processed) around. It is important that researchers do not spend too much time and effort on transferring datasets from one place to another: (1) It should be easy to start a transfer, and (2) transfer speed should be fast.

The course will introduce the basics of dataset transfer. The course will identify possible bottlenecks that can deter fast dataset transfer and show how to overcome them. For example, we will learn why you can get less than 1 Gigabit per second (Gbps) transfer speed with a 10 Gbps network connection, and how to do better. The course will also introduce existing tools and infrastructure that Princeton University has (e.g., dedicated Data Transfer Nodes), which can greatly improve dataset transfer speed.

title: Data Transfer Basics and Best Practices
instructor: Hyojoon Kim
---

It is important that researchers do not spend too much time and effort on transferring datasets from one place to another: (1) It should be easy to start a transfer, and (2) transfer speed should be fast. In this session, we will learn the basics of dataset transfer. We will also explore various different transfer tools out there and learn how to select the best tool for different use cases and situations. I will also introduce existing tools and infrastructure that Princeton University and Research Computing supports (e.g., Data Transfer Nodes with Globus transfer tool), which can greatly improve your data transfer jobs.

The session assumes no prior experience or knowledge about networking or data transfer practices.

Visualization enables insight, verification, and is very valuable for presentations and publications. VisIt has a graphical user interface for exploring and displaying data. It can produce animation to represent complex behavior of variables over time. The software is freely available for Mac, Windows, and Linux platforms and is installed on the Princeton University High Performance Computing Systems. PICSciE's remote visualization capability enables using personal computers to look at large amounts of data kept on the Research Computing storage system.

The session assumes no prior experience with visualization tools. It is intended for researchers interested in developing visual representations of their data.

Organized by [Princeton Research Computing](https://www.princeton.edu/researchcomputing).

**Where**: Princeton University, 121 Lewis Library

**When**: October 29 - Nov 1, 2018  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;          10/29: 8:30 am - 5:00 pm  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;          10/30: 9:00 am - 6:00 pm

This 3.5-day bootcamp will provide an introduction to a variety of topics, tools, and techniques necessary to be successful in modern computational research careers.  Participants will be exposed to many aspects of common computational workflow from version control to visualization and everything in between. Our goal is to provide a broad exposure to a variety of subjects that are likely to be both immediately necessary as well as providing exposure to topics that will provide foundational knowledge and skills useful for future computational endeavors. A tentative agenda can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/agenda). The agenda is expected to be finalized in September.

Lunch and coffee breaks will be provided.

**Registration**: Open to all members of the Princeton research community. Seating is limited so advanced registration is required. **Participants are expected to attend all 4 days.** More registration information can be found on the [Registration page]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration).

**Requirements**: Because of the hands on nature of portions of the bootcamp, each participant should bring a laptop and power supply each day.  

**Prerequisites**: Some basic programming experience particularly in Python and C/C++ is recommended. Some Linux knowledge would be helpful, but not required, as the basics will be covered in the first session.

Recommended resources for those with less experience to review prior to bootcamp:

* [Beginners Guide to Python for Programmers and Non-Programmers](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide)
* [C Tutorial](https://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/c-tutorial.html)
* [C++ Tutorial](https://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/c++-tutorial.html)

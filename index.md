---

Organized by [Princeton Research Computing](https://www.princeton.edu/researchcomputing).

**Where**: Princeton University, 407 Jadwin Hall (PCTS)

**When**: October 29 - Nov 1, 2018  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;          10/29: 8:30 am - 5:00 pm  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;          10/30: 9:00 am - 6:00 pm  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;          10/31: 9:00 am - 5:00 pm  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;          11/1: 9:00 am - 2:00 pm  

This 4-day bootcamp will provide an introduction to a variety of topics, tools, and techniques necessary to be successful in modern computational research careers.  Participants will be exposed to many aspects of common computational workflows from version control to visualization and everything in between. The focus is not on learning specific programming languages.  Instead, our goal is to provide a broad exposure to a variety of subjects that are likely to be both immediately necessary as well as providing exposure to topics that will provide foundational knowledge and skills useful for future computational endeavors.   The bootcamp will consists of a series of short sessions (see [agenda]({{ site.baseurl }}/agenda)) each focused on a different topic.  Some sessions will be lectures, while others will have a combination of lecture and hands-on exercises to help reinforce new topics.

Lunch and coffee breaks will be provided each day.

**Registration**: Open to all current Princeton University researchers/students. Seating is limited so advanced registration is required. **Participants are expected to attend all 4 days.** All participants must have an active PU NetID. A link to the registration site, along with more registration information can be found on the [Registration page]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration).

**Requirements**: Because of the hands on nature of portions of the bootcamp, each participant should bring a laptop and power supply each day.  Prior to the bootcamp all participants should have an adroit account ([register here](https://forms.rc.princeton.edu/registration/?q=adroit)) and an ssh client and Xserver installed and tested on their laptop prior to the bootcamp ([MacOSX, Windows, and Linux instructions]({{ site.baseurl }}/ssh-instructions)).

**Prerequisites**: Some basic programming experience will be expected of participants.  Participants will be assumed to have some understanding of basic programming principles and ideas.  Whenever possible the focus of the bootcamp, will NOT be on specific languages, or advanced programming concepts, however some experience with Python and C/C++ is recommended. Some Linux knowledge would be helpful, but not required, as the basics will be covered in the first session.

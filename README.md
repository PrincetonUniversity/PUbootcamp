# 2018 Princeton Computational Bootcamp

Organized by [PICSciE and Research Computing](https://www.princeton.edu/researchcomputing).

**Where**: Princeton University, 121 Lewis Library
**When**: October 29 - Nov 1, 2018

This 4-day bootcamp will provide an introduction to a variety of topics, tools, and techniques necessary to be successful in modern computational research careers.  Participants will be exposed to many aspects of common computational workflow from version control to visualization and everything in between.  Our goal is to provide a broad exposure to a variety of subjects that are likely to be both immediately necessary as well as providing exposure to topics that will provide foundational knowledge and skills useful for future computational endeavors.

Lunch and coffee breaks will be provided. 

**Registration**: Open to all members of the Princeton community.  Seating is limited so advanced registration is required.   **Participants are expected to attend all 4 days.**

**Prerequisites**: Some basic programming experience particularly in C/C++ and Python is recommended. Basic linux experience is also recommended, but not required.  

Recommended resources for those with less experience (review prior to bootcamp):
<some basic python tutorial>
<some basic C tutorial>
<some basic Linux tutorial>

**Requirements**: Because of the hands on nature of the bootcamp, each participant should bring a laptop and power supply.

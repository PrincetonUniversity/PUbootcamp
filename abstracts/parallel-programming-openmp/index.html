title: Parallel Programming - An introduction to parallel computing with OpenMP
---

Instructor: Ian Cosden

This section will cover the basics of parallel programming with OpenMP.   We will introduce constructs for specifying parallel regions, work sharing, synchronization, and environment management.  Hands on programming exercises will allow participants practice implementing converting existing serial code to run in parallel.

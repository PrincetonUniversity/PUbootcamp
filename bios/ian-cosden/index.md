Ian Cosden is the Manager of HPC Software Engineering and Performance Tuning in the Research Computing department at Princeton University. He leads a team of Research Software Engineers (RSEs) who collectively complement traditional academic research groups by offering embedded, long-term software development expertise. He is the co-PI for the Framework for Integrated Research Software Training in High-Energy Physics (FIRST-HEP), an NSF supported project to develop a community framework for software training to prepare the scientific and engineering workforce needed for the computing challenges of HEP experiments. Prior to his current position, he has held roles as a Performance Tuning Analyst and Research Computing Software & Programming Analyst where he worked with researchers to help build, develop, debug, and optimize serial/parallel scientific codes. He has a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania where he developed the first highly-parallel hybrid atomistic-continuum model for liquid-vapor phase change.
